# Power-Outage-Analysis

Introduction
In this Project I will explore data on major power outage events in the continental U.S. The data is from major power outages witnessed by various states during January 2000-July 2016. The outages dataset contains outages that impacted at least 50,000 customers or caused an unplanned firm load loss of at least 300 MW. The dataset also contains various factors such as geographical locations, electricity consumption, economic characteristics, causes, and regional climatic info.

The dataset was accessed from Purdue University’s Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure at https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages. Throughout this project, we will explore the following question: Which factors, such as location, weather conditions, or population, are most strongly associated with major power outages of greater severity? We can answer this question through data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. After we perform those steps, we can build a predictive model to identify the cause of the next most severe outage.  

The insights we gain from this data is important to everyone, including communities, businesses, and essential services. The question I am exploring may prevent future outages and provide insights into why they occur. Understanding this relationship can help utility companies focus on upgrades or repairs to existing power grids or on how they may be able to prevent the next outage. Along with this, we can identify high-risk areas and the causes to prevent future outages.
